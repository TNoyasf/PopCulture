    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New' , Courier, monospace;">Parks and Recreation</h3>
    <p>What sets Parks and Recreation apart from other comedies is that it’s absolutely sincereand free of cynicism. It’s clear that even if the characters rib each other, there’s genuine
      love between them. But yes, the show is hilarious, and Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope isone of the seminal sitcom characters of our time.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Stranger Things</h3>
    <p>The 80s-set mystery thriller is equal parts It, Stand by Me, and The Goonies as it mashesup the creepy atmosphere of a Stephen King novel with compelling characters and astrong narrative drive. The true test of Stranger Things is whether the show workswithout the nostalgia-inducing 80s setting, and the answer is yes.</p>
